# 6. Design Patterns

## 6.1 Software Architecture

Adopt robust architectural patterns to ensure maintainability, scalability, and efficiency.

**Patterns to Implement**:

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**
  - **Model**: Manages the data and business logic (e.g., trading data, portfolio state).
  - **View**: Handles the presentation layer (e.g., UI components, charts).
  - **Controller**: Manages user input and interacts with the Model to update the View.

- **Entity-Component-System (ECS)**
  - Utilize Godot's native ECS architecture to manage game entities and their behaviors efficiently, especially for handling complex bot interactions and real-time data processing.

- **Singleton Pattern**
  - Implement singletons for global managers (e.g., Trading Engine, Data Loader) to ensure centralized control and easy access across different scenes.

## 6.2 UI/UX Patterns

Ensure a consistent and intuitive user interface by adhering to established UI/UX patterns.

**Patterns to Implement**:

- **Navigation Drawer**
  - Provide easy access to different game modes, settings, and user profiles from a side menu.

- **Modular UI Components**
  - Design reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, panels, charts) to maintain consistency and reduce development time.

- **Wizard Interface**
  - Guide users through complex processes (e.g., bot creation) with step-by-step wizards to simplify interactions.

- **Responsive Design**
  - Ensure the UI adapts gracefully to different screen sizes and resolutions, especially for multi-platform support.

## 6.3 Interaction Design Patterns

Facilitate smooth and engaging interactions within the game.

**Patterns to Implement**:

- **Drag-and-Drop**
  - Enable users to drag and drop elements (e.g., creating bot logic blocks) to create a more interactive and intuitive experience.

- **Progressive Disclosure**
  - Present information and options incrementally to avoid overwhelming users, revealing advanced features as they progress.

- **Real-Time Updates**
  - Implement real-time data feeds for charts and trading actions to simulate live market conditions.

- **Feedback Loops**
  - Provide immediate visual and auditory feedback for user actions (e.g., trade executions, bot actions) to reinforce interactions.
