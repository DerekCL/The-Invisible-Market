# 7. Game Mechanics

## 7.1 Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Analyze**
   - Players examine historical or simulated price charts (candlesticks) and utilize technical indicators (RSI, MACD, moving averages) to identify trading opportunities.

2. **Decide**
   - Based on their analysis, players choose to **buy**, **sell**, or **hold** assets. They select appropriate order types (market, limit, stop).

3. **Execute**
   - Trades are submitted to the simulated exchange, applying transaction fees and updating the portfolio accordingly.

4. **Evaluate**
   - Players assess their performance, review gains/losses, and refine their strategies. Advanced players may program or tweak bot algorithms for automated trading.
