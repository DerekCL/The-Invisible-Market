## 17.1. Player Stories

**Player Story: Beginner Betty**  
*Betty is new to trading and uses The Invisible Market to learn the basics of technical analysis. The tutorial guides her through reading candlestick charts and placing her first trades. She starts with sandbox mode to experiment risk-free before moving to stocks mode, where she earns rewards for executing profitable trades.*

**Player Story: Intermediate Ian**  
*Ian, an intermediate trader, challenges himself by programming bots in The Invisible Market. Using the node-based editor, he creates a bot that identifies breakout patterns. He backtests it on historical data, optimizes its performance, and uses it to start new runs with additional rewards in crypto mode.*
