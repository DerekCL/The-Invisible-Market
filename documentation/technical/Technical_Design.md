## 11.1 Data Management

- **Local Data (CSV)**
  - Primary source for historical market data to ensure consistency and offline availability.
  - Curated datasets to represent various market conditions (bull, bear, sideways).

- **Optional Real-Time API Integration**
  - For advanced features, allow integration with APIs like Alpha Vantage or Polygon.io for live market data.
  - Feature toggle to enable or disable real-time data access.

## 11.2 Architecture Overview

- **Godot (C#)**
  - **Scene Structure**
    - Each game screen (e.g., main menu, trading UI, bot editor) as separate scenes or sub-scenes for modularity.
  - **Core Systems**
    - **Trading Engine**: Handles order placement, execution, fees, and portfolio state management.
    - **Data Loader**: Manages CSV parsing and API data fetching.
    - **Bot Module**: Processes bot logic, automation, and backtesting.
    - **UI Manager**: Oversees UI components, transitions, and user interactions.
    - **Achievement Manager**: Tracks and manages player achievements and milestones.

## 11.3 Performance Considerations

- **Multi-threading**
  - Offload data processing and bot backtesting to separate threads to prevent UI freezes.

- **Efficient Chart Rendering**
  - Update only new candle data to minimize draw calls and enhance rendering performance.

- **Memory Management**
  - Implement data compression or offloading of old data to manage memory usage effectively.

- **Optimization Techniques**
  - Profile and optimize critical code paths to ensure smooth performance across all target platforms.
