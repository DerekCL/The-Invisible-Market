# 10. Automation & Bot Programming

## 10.1 Bot Creation

- **Visual Editor**
  - A node-based system using Godot’s `GraphEdit` and `GraphNode` for constructing trading logic (e.g., “If MACD > 0, then buy”).

- **Custom Scripting**
  - Advanced players can write or modify bot algorithms in C# for more complex strategies.

- **Pre-built Templates**
  - Provide starter bot templates to help users begin without needing extensive programming knowledge.

## 10.2 Backtesting

- **Historical Data Integration**
  - Run bots against curated CSV datasets to simulate past market conditions.

- **Performance Metrics**
  - Evaluate P&L, drawdowns, Sharpe ratio, win rate, and other key performance indicators.

- **Scenario Testing**
  - Test bots under different market scenarios (bull, bear, sideways) to assess robustness.

## 10.3 Bot Upgrades

- **Advanced Indicators**
  - Unlock additional or proprietary technical indicators to enhance bot strategies.

- **Automation Enhancements**
  - Improve bot capabilities, such as reducing reaction times, enabling layered orders, or scaling in/out of trades.

- **AI Integration**
  - Introduce AI-driven suggestions for bot improvements based on performance data.
