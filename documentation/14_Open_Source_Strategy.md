# 14. Open Source Strategy

## 14.1 Licensing

### **Game Code**

- **License**: [Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/)
- **Description**: A weak copyleft license that allows the game code to be used, modified, and distributed while ensuring that modifications to the original code are also shared under the same license. This balances openness with adoption, encouraging community contributions without imposing strict copyleft terms on entire projects that incorporate the code.

### **Game Assets**

- **License**: [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)
- **Description**: Protects the assets by allowing others to remix, tweak, and build upon them non-commercially, as long as they credit the original creation and license their new creations under identical terms.

### **Rationale**

- **MPL-2.0** encourages open collaboration and sharing while protecting the original developer’s rights, making it suitable for balancing openness and adoption.
- **CC BY-NC-SA** ensures that the game’s assets are protected from commercial exploitation while still allowing the community to use and improve them in non-commercial contexts.

## 14.2 Community Contributions

### **Contribution Guidelines**

- **Code Standards**
  - Define coding standards and best practices to maintain code quality.
  - Example: Use consistent indentation, meaningful variable names, and comprehensive commenting.

- **Pull Request Process**
  - Outline the steps for submitting, reviewing, and merging contributions.
  - Example:
    1. Fork the repository.
    2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
    3. Commit your changes with clear messages.
    4. Submit a pull request with a detailed description.

- **Issue Reporting**
  - Provide a structured system for reporting bugs, suggesting features, and tracking progress.
  - Example: Use GitHub Issues with labels like `bug`, `feature`, `enhancement`.

### **Community Engagement**

- **Documentation**
  - Comprehensive documentation to help contributors understand the codebase and development workflow.
  - Include a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with detailed instructions.

- **Forums/Chat**
  - Establish communication channels (e.g., GitHub Discussions, Discord) for collaboration and support.
  - Example: Create a Discord server for real-time communication and support.

- **Recognition**
  - Acknowledge contributors through credits, leaderboards, or special in-game rewards.
  - Example: List top contributors in the `README.md` or in-game credits section.

### **Benefits**

- **Transparency**
  - Builds trust with the community by allowing them to see and modify the source code.

- **Innovation**
  - Leverages diverse perspectives and expertise to enhance the game’s features and performance.

- **Sustainability**
  - Facilitates long-term maintenance and updates through community-driven efforts.

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Set Up Repository**
   - Host the code on a platform like GitHub with a clear README and contribution guidelines.

2. **Create Documentation**
   - Provide detailed documentation on how to set up the development environment, code structure, and contribution process.

3. **Engage the Community**
   - Promote the open-source nature of the game through forums, social media, and developer communities to attract contributors.

4. **Manage Contributions**
   - Regularly review and merge pull requests, respond to issues, and engage with contributors to maintain an active and positive community.
